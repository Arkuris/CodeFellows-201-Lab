        I Worked in Maritime/public transportation for 4+ years, currently I am enrolled in school to pursue a new education in Software Development. In my previous line of work I gained experience in several skills from customer service, to emergency response and first aid. Being adaptable with the ability to take on an unfamiliar challenges and finding a way to complete it is a skill I've adopted and carry into any work or activities I'm apart of.
